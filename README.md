# Flight-Path-Optimization
 A simple implementation of Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest and optimized path for aircrafts in terms of fuel and time efficiency. It calculates the expected time to reach the destination and Fuel left by travelling the optimized path and also calculates the path with less noise  interferance.

 ## Problem Statement 
 In modern aviation, efficient flight path planning is critical for minimizing operational costs, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring timely arrivals. Given the complexities of air travel, including varying fuel consumption rates and time delays due to factors such as noise interference and air traffic, it is essential to develop an algorithm that can determine the most optimal route for aircraft.

 ### Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a simplified version of Dijkstra’s Algorithm to identify the shortest and most efficient flight path for aircraft based on two key metrics: fuel consumption and time efficiency. The algorithm will not only calculate the expected time to reach the destination but also estimate the remaining fuel upon arrival, ensuring that aircraft can complete their journeys safely and effectively.
