# Flight-Path-Optimization
 A simple implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest and optimized path for aircrafts in terms of fuel and time efficiency. It calculates the expected time to reach the destination and Fuel left by travelling the optimized path and also calculates the path with less noise  interferance.
